Advice Wanted - Beginner Class Concerns
First, let me preface this by saying I know it’s not directly a glass-blowing question, but I don’t know who else to request advice from aside from glass-blowers. Not looking for relationship advice but rather glass-blowing safety tips for a nervous beginner. 

Basically, I booked a glass-blowing date/couples class for my partner as their Christmas gift because they love watching glass-blowing shows and follow a bunch of glass-blowers on social media; I thought it might be fun to do a class together <— I’m sure you must hear that a lot with the release of *Blown Away* on Netflix. 

Fast forward to this evening, we are watching the *Blown Away* Christmas special on Netflix and my partner makes a comment about how the reason it’s so fascinating is because it’s “so dangerous”. I pushed them to expand on that comment and asked if it’s something they’d ever like to try - to which I got a firm “absolutely not”. I mentioned that I have a coworker who has taken a few classes and loved them (true, and where I got the gift idea from) and showed them a video on YouTube from the place I booked the class at - definitely still a firm “that’s something I’d never like to do”. Not sure how I completely misinterpreted their level of interest, but here I am. 

The booking is non-transferable, non-refundable; but it’s a few months away. The biggest concern seems to be safety and burns. Is there anything I can say to alleviate this fear?

⚠️⚠️⚠️need experience: glass splinters
has anyone had a very small glass splinter that does not seem to come out? it may be an different issue, and i plan on going to the doctor soon, i may have tiny shard in ball of my foot very close to my toes, that gas been screwing up my whole life for almost 4 months now, i am very stressed over it as it seems to come back every night while im walking around, as long as i continue my normal routines the way i and my body like, as i am an active person, my part time job i walk a lot, and i like to walk around and listen to music or podcast several times a night, sometimes as long as 30 mins, rather than laying down and watching tv, reading, ect., i just feel better that way.  i am very lean and healthy (M, 33) also.  But, this is really changing that, and i am very overtaxed/overstressed/overattentive/overencumbered with it, and has slowed me down and  i dont feel good, and imbalanced my movement, flow states, blood pressure, digestion, ect.

Can very small pieces be seen under xray/mri?
